1. Open deployement.yaml 
2. Increase replicas to 2
3. run kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
4. Again go to yaml file and reduce replicas to 1.
5. run kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

OR
##Directly modify deployment strategies into deployment.yaml file
spec:
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 0
      maxSurge: 1


maxUnavailable(0)==> Means system should've 0 pod unavailable any particulaer time.
maxSurge(1)==>It means system can have max 1 pod runing at any time.
So kubernetes will deploye new version by incrementing/decrementing old version to new version internally to achieve 0 downtime.
