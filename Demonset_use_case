DaemonSet will ensure that one copy of pod defined in our configuration will always be available on every worker node.
       --The total # of pods running in DaemonSet = Number of worker nodes in our cluster.
If a new node is added in our cluster then DaemonSet will automatically allocate pod on that node. 
Similarly, if a node is deleted then the pod running on the node is also destroyed.

Let’s take a scenario where we have to create a pod containing nginx image in it. Below are the configuration files for creating DaemonSet. 
Save this configuration in DemonSet.yml file.

apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nginx
  name: example-daemon
spec:
  template:
     metadata:
       labels:
        app: nginx
     spec:   
       containers:
         – name: nginx
           image: nginx
           
           
This is the configuration of a DaemonSet for nginx.To create the Deamon Set, execute below commands.
$kubectl create -f DemonSet.yml
This daemonSet will create a pod in every node running in our cluster.

Note: Another important use case is run "performance monitoring pod" on every node. This is where DS is very much usefull.
